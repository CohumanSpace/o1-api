# Claude Code Marketplace Registration Guide

This guide explains how to register and publish the o1.exchange Trading API skill in various Claude Code marketplaces.

## Overview of Claude Code Skills and Marketplaces

**Skills** are folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Each skill is self-contained with a `SKILL.md` file containing instructions and metadata.

**Plugin Marketplaces** are catalogs that distribute plugins/skills to others, providing centralized discovery, version tracking, automatic updates, and support for multiple source types.

## Registration Options
